Code associated with Fiorenza et al. 2020. "It's a wormy world: Meta-analysis reveals several decades of change in the global abundance of the parasitic nematodes Anisakis spp. and Pseudoterranova spp. in marine fishes and invertebrates". Global Change Biology.

This code refers to several datasets: one raw meta-analytic dataset on the abundance of Anisakis spp. and Pseudoterranova spp. nematodes in studies downloaded from Web of Science (anisakid_data.csv), a dataset specifying the FAO Major Fishing Area of each collection site included in anisakid_data.csv (anisakid_fao.csv), a dataset containing the correct Latin names of all the host species included in anisakid_data.csv (host_data.csv), and two datasets containing the processed data that were used for meta-analysis and which arise from the raw dataset anisakid_data.csv: one for Anisakis spp. (processed_data_anisakis.csv) and one for Psuedoterranova spp. (processed_data_pseudoterranova.csv).

Note that a metadata file is provided for all of the data files (metadata.csv).

Data are available in this repository, and are also permanently archived in Dryad:
